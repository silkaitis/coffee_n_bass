## Purpose
The purpose is to automate the process of updating a new show on DNBRadio and publishing across other platforms. Playlists are automatically generated on digital turntables (i.e. Pioneer XDJ-1000) making process automation simple. Minimal input is required from the DJ to update their latest show after initial setup.

## DJing Background
I started listening to Drum & Bass in 2002 and had turntables for many years before putting them to serious use. I hit the digital airwaves in 2009 with his first weekly show focusing on Liquid Drum n Bass. In 2015, I made the switch to [DNBRadio](https://dnbradio.com) where I continues to push my favorite sounds every Friday out of Seattle. My show, [Coffee n Bass](http://www.ritcheydnb.com), is up-beat, soulful and funky and is best enjoyed with your morning coffee or afternoon tea.
